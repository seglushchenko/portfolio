                 <h2><strong>Scratch Project</strong></h2>
                  <p>This was a project I did with partners at the beginning of 9th grade (September 2018). This project introduced me to using blocks and different commands to create a simple game. It allowed me to explore features such as controlling with the arrows and space, make animations, and create different levels to a game. </p>
                  <p>The game we have created was a storyline/ controlling game. It included three main levels and each had dialogue along with instructions and animations. The player was able to use the arrows, space, and mouse to guide their way through the obstacles of the game. Each level got a little more challenging, and in the end, after passing, the story would finish with a happy ending.</p>

                  <h2><strong>App Inventor Project</strong></h2>
              </div>
              <p>This project was also done in CSP class in 9th grade. This was slightly more challenging than the Scratch one is it included much more blocks and complex features to create many different types of games. The one I created with my partner specifically, was a trivia game. I connected it to the tablets and made sure it is working on there. This project taught me how to connect the computer to other devices and create an android game. It also allowed me to expand my communicating skills by working with a partner and problem solving skills by thinking of different solutions for particular problems/glitches.</p>
