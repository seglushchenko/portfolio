                                <h5>Date: August 2018</h5>
                                <p><strong>Objective: Introduction to 
                                working with command blocks and combining the 
                                to create functions.</p></strong>
                                <p>This was a project I did with partners at the
                                beginning of 9th grade (August 2018). This
                                project introduced me to using blocks and 
                                different commands to create a simple game. It 
                                allowed me to explore features such as 
                                controlling with the arrows and space, make
                                animations, and create different levels to a
                                game. </p>
                                <p>The game we have created was a storyline 
                                controlling game. It included three main levels 
                                and each had dialogue along with instructions
                                and animations. The player was able to use the 
                                arrows, space, and mouse to guide their way
                                through the obstacles of the game. Each level 
                                got a little more challenging, and in the end, 
                                after passing, the story would finish with a
                                happy ending.</p>

                                <h5>Date: September/October 2018</h5>
                                <p><strong>Objective: To learn how to create a
                                game with app inventor and connect it to an 
                                Android device.</strong></h4>
                                <p>This project was also done in CSP class in 
                                9th grade. This was slightly more challenging 
                                than the Scratch one is it included much more 
                                blocks and complex features to create many 
                                different types of games. The one I created with
                                my partner specifically, was a trivia game about
                                our school with a timer, images that went along
                                with the questions, space for typing answer,
                                and display of correct answer. We connected it
                                to Android tablets and made sure it is working 
                                on them.</p>
                                <p>This project taught me how to connect the
                                computer to other devices and create a game used
                                on an Android tablet. It also allowed me to
                                expand my communicating skills by working with
                                a partner and problem solving skills by thinking
                                of different solutions for particular problems/
                                glitches. Our thinking process was to create a 
                                simple trivia game but to add a twist, such as a 
                                timer. As well as, small details such as images
                                to customize. App Inventor taught me a lot about
                                customizing and working with Android, but also
                                communicating well wtih a partner to solve a 
                                problem.</p>

                                <p>This project was also done in CSP class in 
                                9th grade. My partner and I used the programmig
                                language Python in Cloud 9 to create a story 
                                line. We included many decisions to be made 
                                by the user and points were accumalated 
                                throughout the game. Based on the decisions
                                the user made, the story got more or less points
                                . This required us to use many if/else statements
                                and potential situations for each scenario.</p>
                                <p>This project taught me how to use the basics
                                of Cloud 9 and how to connect the file to the 
                                terminal. It showed me how to run my code and
                                create a user-friendly game using Python. It
                                also taught me lots of communcation skills as my
                                partner and I had to figure out solutions to 
                                problems that appeared throughout the code.</p>
