                        <p>Hello! My name is Stacy Glushchenko. I am a freshman 
                        in high school, and throughout high school, I hope to 
                        take many engineering and computer science courses as to
                        advance my learning in these subjects. I hope to become 
                        a software engineer when I grow up and possibly a 
                        developer. I like solving problems by working with 
                        others and creating something new, in order to advance 
                        on different programs and projects which is why this 
                        field would be a good one for me.</p>
                        <p>Although I am passionate about computer science, 
                        there are many other activities that interest me. I am 
                        a dancer and a runner in track and field. Spending time
                        with family and friends is very important to me and I 
                        think of my self as good with people. I love outdoor 
                        activities as much as indoor ones and I love learning 
                        something new. This is why coding is very fitting for me 
                        because it allows me to explore different features every
                        day.</p>
                        <p>Through my first year of highschool, in 9th grade, 
                        CSP has taught me so much. Not only what the internet
                        is and how it works, but numerous coding languages
                        such as HTML, CSS, Python, and even Java. Taking this
                        class has sparked interest in learning more about how
                        to develop code and do countless things with it. I
                        cannot wait to work with my peers in the engineering
                        academy, as well as future computer science classes.
                        Thank you for reading my About Me page! Be sure to 
                        explore the rest of my website.</p>
